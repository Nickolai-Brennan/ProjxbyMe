Structured GPT Prompt Template

Step 1: Establish Clear Objectives

Define the main goal of your prompt. A clear objective helps focus the AI’s response, whether it’s generating a story, summarizing an article, or answering a technical question.

Objective: Explain [topic] in [format] for [audience level or purpose].
Example Objective: Summarize key trends in AI technology for a non-technical audience.

Step 2: Structure the Prompt with Key Components

1. Instruction: Give a concise command that directs the AI on what to do.

Write an explanation of…
Compare two methods…
Describe the process of…


2. Context: Provide background information, audience considerations, or any specific scenario that frames the response.

For a marketing manager, explain how GPT can help with social media engagement.


3. Constraints: Define boundaries for the response, such as length, tone, or format.

Limit the response to 150 words.
Use a friendly and engaging tone.
Provide the answer in bullet points.


4. Examples (Optional): Add an example or reference style to guide the AI in tone, structure, or content expectations.

Example: “Our eco-friendly product is durable, stylish, and sustainable.”

Step 3: Review Prompt Parameters

Use this checklist to ensure your prompt includes the necessary parameters:

Audience: Does the AI understand who the response is for? (e.g., beginner, expert, customer, etc.)

Tone: Is the tone appropriate? (e.g., formal, friendly, professional)

Format: Is the desired format specified? (e.g., list, paragraph, outline)

Scope: Is the length or detail level clear? (e.g., short summary, in-depth explanation)

Constraints: Are there any specific boundaries? (e.g., exclude certain topics, keep response under 200 words)

Step 4: Test and Refine the Prompt

After generating a response, evaluate whether it aligns with the objectives. If not, refine the prompt by adjusting the instruction, context, or constraints. Repeat as necessary.
